/// The single source of truth for persisting the shared `(configuration, library)` PAIR: bump the
/// configuration generation past the on-disk value, stamp the library to pair with it, and write both
/// files atomically in the fail-safe order.
///
/// Extracted (Phase 3, "share the core") so the foreground persist paths
/// (`AppViewModel.persistSharedState` / `persistConfigurationOnly`) and the headless warm-switch service
/// commit IDENTICAL write-ordering + generation-token semantics and can never drift. Pure file I/O over
/// value types — no `AppViewModel`, no `@Published`, no actor — so it is callable from the background
/// command-service context as well as the main actor. Takes the two file URLs explicitly so it stays in
/// LavaSecCore (auto-compiled + unit-testable) without depending on the app-side App Group constants.
///
/// SERIALIZATION INVARIANT (see `SharedConfigurationWriterInvariantSourceTests`):
/// `writeConfigurationAndLibrary` is SYNCHRONOUS — it reads the on-disk generation and writes BOTH files
/// with NO `await`/suspension in between — so each call is one indivisible slice WITHIN a process. Through
/// Phase 3 that was sufficient: every production caller was a `@MainActor AppViewModel` publisher and the
/// Focus App Intent executed IN the same app process, so all writers shared the one main-actor executor
/// and serialized.
///
/// CROSS-PROCESS CAS (LAV-100 Phase 4): the App Intents EXTENSION is now a SECOND writer process, so the
/// @MainActor funnel no longer serializes everything — two processes could read the same on-disk
/// generation and interleave the two file writes, producing a same-generation mismatched (config, library)
/// pair or a lost update. To close that, callers pass `crossProcessLockURL` and the read-generation
/// -then-write critical section runs under an exclusive `flock` on that file. Taken by BOTH the foreground
/// publishers AND the extension's commit, it makes the slice indivisible ACROSS processes too — restoring
/// the "no two writers read the same generation, no interleave" guarantee. `nil` (tests / a caller with no
/// container) degrades to the in-process-only behavior. The tunnel only READS the pair. The lock now adds
/// mutual exclusion; RECENCY still comes from the monotonic generation bump (read under the same lock).
///
/// LOCK ORDERING (Kilo #29): a Focus/App Intents commit acquires locks in this strict order —
/// `focusSwitchLock` (HeadlessFocusFilterSwitchEngine.withFocusSwitchLock) → the cross-process
/// configuration-write flock (`crossProcessLockURL`, taken here in `writeConfigurationAndLibrary`) →
/// the artifact `publishLock` (FilterPublishLock, taken in `FilterSnapshotPreparationService.persistArtifacts`).
/// The FOREGROUND publisher takes only the latter two and NEVER `focusSwitchLock`, so the two contexts
/// can't form a cycle and there is no deadlock today. Any future change that makes a holder of a LATER
/// lock acquire an EARLIER one (e.g. taking `focusSwitchLock` while holding the write flock or publish
/// lock) would introduce a lock-order inversion — preserve the order above.
